A tool for downloading BARRA version 2 (BARRA2) atmospheric reanalysis data.

## Background

barra2-dl is a Python package to bulk download data from
BARRA2 reanalysis data for a specific latitude and longitude. It is for use in 
wind resource and energy assessments, but can be used to download other data from BARRA2.

> BARRA2 provides the Bureau's higher resolution regional atmospheric reanalysis
> over Australia and surrounding regions, spanning 1979-present day time period.
> When completed, it replaces the first version of BARRA (Su et al.,
> doi: 10.5194/gmd-14-4357-2021; 10.5194/gmd-12-2049-2019).
>
>It is produced using the Bureau's data assimilation system for numerical weather
> prediction - 4D variational scheme, and ACCESS as a limited-area dynamical
> coupled atmosphere-land model - Unified Model (UM) and JULES.
>
>The data set includes sub-daily, daily and monthly data for temperature,
> moisture, wind and flux variables at sub-surface, surface, and pressure levels,
> and heights above surface. The vertical levels include many pressure levels and
> several heights above surface.

Data from BARRA2 can be downloaded in netCDF or CSV format from the NCI THREDDS server.

However, BARRA2 is structured with data for each variable saved in separate folders with separate files for each month. 
Therefore, for the purpose of downloading a subset of variables for a specific location, 
a recursive web request is required using the NetcdfSubset Data Access to get subsetted data.

This package and example scripts provides examples to recursively download data in csv (for point data) relevant to wind farm resource analysis for
specific locations and time periods. 

The following links provide an example of the urls:

import barra2_dl

from barra2_dl.globals import barra2_var_wind_50m, barra2_var_wind_default, BARRA2_AUS11_INDEX

urlfilenames = barra2_dl.download.point_data_urlfilenames(
    barra2_vars = barra2_var_wind_default,
    latitude = -23.5527472,
    longitude = 133.3961111,
    start_datetime= datetime.strptime("2023-01-01T00:00:00Z", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"),
    end_datetime = datetime.strptime("2023-03-31T23:00:00Z", "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"),

## Roadmap
1) Currently, only AUS-11 1hr is implemented. 
2) Add option for AUS-22 and AUST-04
3) Implement bulk download for netCDF (for gridded data) 
4) Add download progress bar
5) Multi-location download
6) CLI interface
